PyMoli Observations - Homework 4

1.  Given the fact that there are more male players that have a higher average purchase value of $1,967.64, we can assume that the top spenders are most
likely comprised of mostly male players.  Also, that these top spenders are likely in the 20-24 age group.

2.  There are two games that are on the top five of most popular list (Persuasion and Quickblad of Trembling Hands Extraction)
that are not represented in the most profitable items.  By looking at the total purchase values we can observe that these two popular games are about 
$10-$30 dollars cheaper than the top three most popular games.  

3.  Based on the purchase analysis by gender, we observe that in addition to being least likely to play games, females are also least likely to 
spend money on games.  Also, given the fact that the majority of players are within the 20-24 age group, we can assume that most of the players
in this group are male.  However, based on the average purchase total per person, we can't discount the idea that the majority of female players 
are also in this age group.
